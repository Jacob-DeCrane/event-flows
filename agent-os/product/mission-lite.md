# Product Mission (Lite)

EventFlows is a framework-agnostic TypeScript library that helps developers adopt Clean Architecture, DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing patterns by providing simple, extensible primitives that lower the barrier to entry for building event-sourced applications.

EventFlows serves TypeScript developers who want to implement event sourcing and CQRS without framework lock-in or infrastructure constraints. Unlike opinionated libraries that require specific databases or message brokers, EventFlows provides clear abstractions that developers implement for their chosen infrastructure, while offering comprehensive documentation that teaches the architectural patterns themselves. With only one production dependency and extensive architectural guides, EventFlows enables teams to understand and apply these patterns with confidence and flexibility.
